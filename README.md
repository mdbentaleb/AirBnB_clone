## AirBnB Clone - The Console

The "AirBnB Clone - The Console" project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program.
It is the first step in building a full web application similar to AirBnB.
This project focuses on creating a custom command-line interface (CLI) to manage various aspects of the application, such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving objects.


# Usage

To start the console, run:
```bash
  ./console.py
```
This will open an interactive command prompt where you can enter commands to manage the application objects.

# Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows you to interact with the application through various commands.
It provides functionalities to create, update, delete, and retrieve instances of different classes.

# Supported Commands

The following commands are supported by the command interpreter:

 - `help`   : Displays the help documentation.
 - `quit`   : Exits the console.
 - `create` : Creates a new instance of a class.
 - `show`   : Retrieves an instance based on its class and id.
 - `destroy`: Deletes an instance based on its class and id.
 - `all`    : Displays all instances, optionally filtered by class.
 - `update` : Updates an instance with new attribute values.
